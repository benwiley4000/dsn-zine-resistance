                        <p>This is not out of sympathy, nor is it a donation. It is action<br>

                            <p>The theme of this issue is resistance.<br>
                                How do we resist? How can resistance<br>
                                inspire us? How can resistance heal us?<br>
                                How do we turn day to day resistance<br>
                                into a movement?</p>
                            <p>In this movement, we talk a<br>
                                lot about narrative. Here, we<br>
                                place ourselves within that<br>
                                narrative. In some ways, a<br>
                                movement is just a group of<br>
                                humans telling a new story.<br>
                                Here are some of ours.</p>

                                    for community members, helped organize the Richmond Our
                                    Power Festival, and attended Bay Area Air Quality
                                    Management Board (BAAQMD) meetings to push for stronger
                                    air quality controls on Richmond's Chevron refinery.

                                <p><strong>Amy: From your experience working with APEN, what purpose
                                    would you say the organization serves in the communities
                                    it organizes?</strong></p>
                                <p>Yin: APEN is a community organization in Richmond and
                                    Oakland that really works to create a just transition away
                                    from our current exploitative economy towards smaller,
                                    local economies that actually care about people and not
                                    just profit. The organization does focus on environmental
                                    justice, but I was really grateful to see that they're not
                                    just fighting for the environment but for all social justice
                                    issues, including racial justice and housing justice.</p>

                                    change the way you approach your divestment work?</strong></p>
                                <p>Y: Working with APEN really gave me new perspective on the
                                    meaning of climate justice&mdash;though APEN doesn't center
                                    divestment, it really does focus on just transition and
                                    reinvestment, which are both important next steps towards
                                    climate justice after we win divestment. It also made me
                                    think differently about building power and creating change,
                                    like I really liked how APEN works at all levels of power,
                                    from doing leadership development within the community to
                                    mobilizing members to lobby California state legislators. They
                                    aren't just trying to make change in the boardroom like a lot
                                    of divestment campaigns do, but they're actually empowering
                                    community members. Through my organizing, I've been able to
                                    understand how important it is to show people that they have
                                    the power to fight injustice, even if they've been disempowered
                                    their entire lives.</p>

                                <p><strong>A: What was your experience entering and working in a community
                                    that was so new to you?</strong></p>
                                <p>Y: At APEN, even though we were organizing around pan-Asian
                                    solidarity, I still saw myself as different from the community
                                    members. They were majority Chinese immigrants, with some Mien
                                    and Laotian refugees, but there was nobody from Burma. I don't
                                    think I had a very strong relationship to any of the community
                                    members because I didn't speak their languages, but I really
                                    enjoyed working with them during political education workshops
                                    at APEN academy and other events like the Our Power Festival!</p>
                                <p><strong>A: Did APEN's explicit focus on racial justice change the way you
                                    see climate justice or organizing?</strong></p>
                                <p>Y: Definitely. I hadn't thought much about race when I started
                                    divestment organizing, but since being in spaces for people of
                                    color at APEN and the DSN and fellowship POC Caucuses, I've
                                    realized how few people of color there are in divestment work.
                                    Being in these spaces has helped me open up and share more about
                                    the ways I've felt different or insecure about my race and
                                    certain cultural differences. It also taught me about how
                                    important it is to organize low-income communities of color,
                                    which are most vulnerable to climate change but have so much
                                    power to push the just transition forward.</p>

                                    I'm curious to know if your experience growing up in Burma also
                                    motivated you to do climate justice work?</strong></p>
                                <p>Y: Yeah, Burma has suffered a lot from both environmental
                                    injustice and climate change. Recently, there was heavy flooding
                                    across the country, where almost two-thirds of the country
                                    experienced flooding, and a lot of people died. One of the main
                                    reasons for this flooding was that the Burmese government
                                    started cutting down rainforests to export the timber to China.
                                    With all of the deforestation, there's no more natural barrier
                                    to storms, and scientists say that, because of climate change,
                                    we should expect these storms to get more and more intense in
                                    the future. China also has plans to build a dam on our largest
                                    river, which would displace all of the local people in the area.
                                    For now, the government's stopped dam construction, but they
                                    still have a contract to move forward with the project. When I
                                    think about Burma, I really see the need for people to rise up
                                    and fight back against injustice. </p>

                                <p>Y: The political situation in Burma right now is really difficult.
                                    I have a lot of hope for the climate justice movement in the
                                    U.S., especially after meeting so many incredible people here
                                    who are devoting their lives to the movement, but in Burma,
                                    people are too scared of challenging the government to really
                                    organize. On Facebook, I'll post about the upcoming Burmese
                                    elections or about injustice in my country, and I'll have
                                    friends and family members tell me to stop. They think that the
                                    government could be monitoring me, and that they might even
                                    throw me in jail when I get back. I understand where they're
                                    coming from, because I grew up in the same culture of fear&mdash;
                                    like when I was young, all my parents would ever say about the
                                    government is that there's nothing to be done because they're
                                    too powerful. I know that's not true, and we have the power to
                                    fight back, but I do think that the current government makes it
                                    very dangerous.</p>

                                <p>Y: I think it really depends on how the upcoming elections in
                                    Burma go, because I really don't trust the current government
                                    and that's partly why I came to the U.S. If the political
                                    situation gets better, I want to go back to my country to
                                    organize the people there, but if I can get a work permit, I
                                    would love to continue organizing for climate justice in the
                                    U.S. Recently, I've thought a lot about how everywhere I've
                                    been&mdash;even democratic countries like the U.S.&mdash;
                                    there's always injustice and people who are doing nothing
                                    about it because they don't think they have the power to
                                    fight back. It makes me really emotional, but it also makes
                                    me resilient. We're the generation that has no choice but to
                                    fight injustice. And we have to fight back.</p>

                <div class="column-content-container">
                    <div class="content-column">
                        <div class="content-div">
                            <p>
                                The white boy told me that he should be in front. He told me, "Well we're trying to serve as barriers from the police! We [white allies] should be in the front!<br/>
                                We're protecting people. We need to be in the front!"<br/>
                                I asked him if he didn't realize how problematic that statement was coming from him.<br/>
                                And if he couldn't see his white savior complex perspective. [He wasn't asked to stand in front]<br/>
                                I'm here to save you because you're so helpless. You need me. <br/>
                                The martyr mentality is so prevalent in activist spheres.<br/>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There's a way to be an ally without taking the voice away from those who were (and are) actually aggrieved.<br/>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Pushing buttons makes one cede their privilege, which is what the so-called "white allies" didn't want.<br/>
                                Classic "have your cake and eat it too" syndrome.<br/>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                They were afraid of what others would think if they spoke up, so who cares if we push buttons?<br/>
                                Isn't that the point? It's so easy to feel good about yourself and say you're participating yet being able to hide it when it's convenient: being able to say you want to talk about issues and backing away when it comes to truly confronting it. <br/>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The issue of race and white privilege may make you upset. <br/>
                                You can show up to protests, or be part of the same type of collective that attempts to talk about the very issue of race.<br/>
                                It won't affect you because the problem isn't in front of you.<br/>
                                You didn't witness or experience violence.<br/>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You weren't dehumanized.<br/>
                                You don't have a child who was left to bleed or (unjustly) shot multiple times<br/>
                                Simply because of the color of the skin he was born in.<br/>
                                Your body will never be criminalized.<br/>
                                You haven't seen people you love lose their lives<br/>
                                From unnecessary violence and animosity.<br/>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That's not to say that some of us haven't either...but this is an issue that needs to be spoken about because everyone deserves the right to life, equality, and justice.<br/>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We need to talk about those who have been forgotten and disregarded as human beings<br/>
                                Who have lost their lives to corruption, hatred, and racism. <br/>
                                We cannot allow it to happen any longer.<br/>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We shouldn't be afraid to speak and raise the volume around campuses<br/>
                                About the issues that exist. We cannot be afraid because someone will get their feelings hurt.<br/>
                                You shouldn't give yourself brownie points for being a decent person.<br/>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It goes beyond "being aware" of one's privilege. It's about listening. It's about understanding. <br/>
                                Learning to be a proper "ally," standing behind, raising the voices of black people of color, and not allowing your voice to drown out those who need to be heard.<br/>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Remember<br/>
                                "All lives matter" = "White lives matter"<br/>
                                Society knows this.<br/>
                                We don't need to be reminded.<br/>
                            </p>
